{5014}{}{ und hinterlässt einen verstümmelten rechten Arm}
{5015}{}{. His right arm is pulverized by this powerful blow}
{5016}{}{ in a forceful blow}
{5017}{}{, durchdringt die Rüstung}
{5018}{}{ und richtet zusätzlichen Schaden an}
{5019}{}{ right through his armor, knocking the combatant to the ground}

{5022}{}{ putting a major hurt on his leg}
{5023}{}{ und wirft ihn wie einen Kegel zu Boden}
{5024}{}{, bowling him over and chopping off that leg like a scarlet side of meat}
{5025}{}{ und bläst das Knie bis in die nächste Stadt. Er fällt}
{5026}{}{. Der intensive Schmerz des Beinverlusts lässt ihn einhalten}
{5027}{}{ inflicting some extra pain}

{5029}{}{, and with no protection there, causing serious pain}
{5030}{}{ und blendet ihn mit einem atemberaubenden Schlag}
{5031}{}{. The loss of an eye is too much for him, and he falls to the ground}
{5032}{}{, sadly, he is too busy feeling the rush of air on the brain to notice death approaching}
{5033}{}{. Ouch! That had to hurt}
{5034}{}{, and he's not wearing a cup, either}
{5035}{}{ and without protection, he falls over, groaning in agony}
{5036}{}{. The pain is too much for him and he collapses like a rag}
{5037}{}{. He mumbles 'Mother', as his eyes roll into the back of his head}
{5100}{}{ and really hurts}
{5101}{}{. The strike causes immense pain}
{5102}{}{ slipping past her armor}
{5103}{}{. The damaging attack knocks her unconscious}
{5104}{}{. The blow knocks her to the ground}
{5105}{}{. The strong blow to the head knocks her out}
{5106}{}{. The attack crushes her temple in a fountain of blood. Good night, Gracie}
{5107}{}{, spinning her into a dance of death. Death is instantaneous}
{5108}{}{ und führt zu einem heftigen Tennisarm}
{5109}{}{ und stößt den Arm zur Seite}
{5110}{}{ und hinterlässt einen großen blauen Fleck}
{5111}{}{, puncturing through her left elbow with ease}
{5112}{}{. The left arm is barely attached to her shoulder}
{5113}{}{. That arm now looks like a bloody stump}
{5114}{}{, crippling the arm in a crimson shower}
{5115}{}{. Her right arm is turned into hamburger by the blow}
{5116}{}{ in a forceful blow}
{5117}{}{ piercing through her defenses}
{5118}{}{ und richtet zusätzlichen Schaden an}
{5119}{}{ bypassing the armor, knocking the female fighter to the ground}
{5120}{}{ knocking the air out. She slumps to the ground}
{5121}{}{. Unfortunately for her, most organs have now been exposed to the light}
{5122}{}{ putting a major hurt on her leg}
{5123}{}{, knocking her over like a bad blind date}
{5124}{}{, knocking her down and blasting that leg into ground round}
{5125}{}{, smashing the knee into the next town. She takes the fast track to the ground}
{5126}{}{. She screams in pain from the broken leg}
{5127}{}{ inflicting some extra pain}
{5128}{}{ causing blindness. She grimaces}
{5129}{}{, and with no protection there, causing serious pain}
{5130}{}{. The wound causes severe blindness, as if there is any other kind}
{5131}{}{. She faints from the blinding attack}
{5132}{}{, sadly, she doesn't get to pray to her gods before she meets them}
{5133}{}{. She takes it like a man. That is to say, it hurts}
{5134}{}{ und wirft sie zu Boden}
{5135}{}{. Her childbearing days are numbered as she collapses in a limp heap}
{5200}{}{. The little kid starts to cry}
{5201}{}{. Unconscious, the small child falls over}
{5202}{}{. Ouchie!}
{5203}{}{. Der Schlag sitzt, und das Kind wird bewusstlos}
{5204}{}{ und schleudert das kleine Kind wie einen nassen Lappen herum}
{5205}{}{. The left arm of this kid now has an owie}
{5206}{}{ und bringt das kleine Kind aus dem Gleichgewicht}
{5207}{}{ und bricht den Arm mit einem lauten Knacken. Tränen fließen in Strömen}
{5208}{}{ und zerbricht den Arm wie eine Zuckerstange}
{5209}{}{. The right arm starts to swell, like a balloon}
{5210}{}{ und beginnt zu weinen}
{5211}{}{ in a sensitive spot}
{5212}{}{. The attack to a vital organ knocks the kid over}
{5213}{}{ und wirft das kleine Kind um wie ein Spielzeug}
{5214}{}{. Now this young child will never really experience life}
{5215}{}{ und fügt eine tiefe Wunde zu}
{5216}{}{. The attack bowls the child over, and breaks the leg}
{5217}{}{ und fügt dem kleinen Kind großen Schaden zu}
{5218}{}{. The young child looks up and starts to cry}
{5219}{}{, was den kleinen Menschen erblinden lässt}
{5220}{}{, bashing in the youthful looking nose}
{5221}{}{. Eine Wunde klafft über den Augen, und das Blut fließt in Strömen}
{5222}{}{, which opens an eye like an exploding grape. The child looks bewildered}
{5223}{}{ causing blindness. The young child drops to the ground}
{5224}{}{, the blow continues into the small brain and turns it into slag}
{5225}{}{. The child looks confused and shaken}
{5226}{}{ und wirft das junge Opfer zu Boden}
{5300}{}{ und verletzt den mächtigen Mutanten}
{5301}{}{, striking a vital spot}
{5302}{}{, striking a vital spot and knocking the giant to the ground}
{5303}{}{. The giant mutant looks around for a moment, and then slumps to the ground}
{5304}{}{. The head explodes like a giant, bloody watermelon}
{5305}{}{ und verletzt den mächtigen Mutanten ernsthaft}
{5306}{}{ und lässt den Mutanten einen Augenblick lang das Universum verfluchen}
{5307}{}{und trifft einen Nerv, weswegen der Riese schmerzerfüllt nach seinem Arm greift}
{5308}{}{. The blow breaks the elbow and probably didn't feel too good}
{5309}{}{, breaking the thick arm and spewing mutant blood over the ground}
{5310}{}{, lässt den Riesen einen Moment lang stolpern und dann wie einen gefällten Baum umkippen}
{5311}{}{, and gallons of viscera splurt to the ground}
{5312}{}{ und schickt den Riesen fliegend zu Boden}
{5313}{}{. The mutant stumbles and falls, his leg barely able to support him}
{5314}{}{ und trifft eine wichtige Stelle. Der Mutant bricht mit einem gebrochenen Bein zusammen}
{5315}{}{. The pain of a broken leg overwhelms the mighty giant}
{5316}{}{ und lässt den Mutanten fast erblinden}
{5317}{}{ und lässt den wütenden Mutanten erblinden}
{5318}{}{, not quite blinding the mutant but throwing him off balance}
{5319}{}{. The blinded mutant stumbles back, unprepared for the next attack}
{5320}{}{ und lässt den bewusstlosen Mutanten erblinden}
{5321}{}{. The eyes of the mutant glow for a moment, and then the light fades - permanently}
{5400}{}{. The ghoul is surprised, and fails to defend against this attack}
{5401}{}{. The blow buries this ghoul}
{5402}{}{. The stunned ghoul's hand flies open}
{5403}{}{, sneaking through his armor and striking a critical joint}
{5404}{}{, sneaking through his armor and lopping the arm off}
{5405}{}{. The ghoul moves the wrong way at the wrong moment, and loses an eye}
{5406}{}{. The ghoul is wearing no armor there}
{5407}{}{, and the eye explodes like a blood sausage}
{5408}{}{, causing the ghoul to look bewildered in his final moments}
{5500}{}{ und wirft das große Ungetüm um}
{5501}{}{, stunning both brains and felling the giant animal}
{5502}{}{. The mutant cow gives a loud, startled cry}
{5503}{}{, breaking one of the brahma's legs}
{5504}{}{ und verletzt die Mutantenkuh ernsthaft}
{5505}{}{ und durchdringt ganz einfach die dicke Haut des Riesenviehs}
{5506}{}{ und durchdringt glatt beide Herzen der Mutantenkuh}
{5507}{}{ und blendet beide Augenpaare mit einem einzigen Schlag}
{5508}{}{, lässt beide Köpfe erblinden und betäubt die Mutantenkuh}
{5509}{}{, completely blinding the brahma and knocking it out}
{5510}{}{, the large mutant bovine stumbles for a moment}
{5511}{}{. The brahma shakes with rage}
{5512}{}{. The brahma snorts with pain}
{5513}{}{. The brahma is most upset with this udderly devastating attack}
{5600}{}{, sending the radscorpion flying on its back}
{5601}{}{ und trennt den Kopf vom Rückenpanzer}
{5602}{}{ und schädigt den Schwanz ernsthaft}
{5603}{}{ und verletzt seine Klauen schlimm}
{5604}{}{. The blow slips between the cracks of the radscorpion's tough carapace}
{5605}{}{ und durchdringt den harten Rückenschild ohne Schwierigkeiten}
{5606}{}{, passing through the natural armor and knocking the radscorpion over}
{5607}{}{. The radscorpion cannot cope with a new sensation, like missing internal organs}
{5608}{}{, sending the 'scorpion flying and crippling some of its legs}
{5609}{}{. The attack cuts through an unprotected joint on the leg, severing it}
{5610}{}{ und verwundet und blendet das Mutantenwesen schwer}
{5611}{}{ und dringt fast bis ins Hirn vor. So ist das also, wenn man Ungeziefer zerquetscht}
{5612}{}{ und dringt nur fast bis ins Hirn vor, lässt das Wesen jedoch erblinden}
{5613}{}{. The attack is fiendish, and far too sophisticated for this simple creature}
{5614}{}{. If it were human, you would swear it's pretty pissed off}
{5615}{}{ und schlägt das arme Wesen besinnungslos}
{5616}{}{ und nagelt das Hirn an den Boden}
{5700}{}{. The rodent's skull makes several unhealthy sounds}
{5701}{}{ und zerquetscht den Schädel des Nagetiers wie eine nasse Papiertüte}
{5702}{}{, and the left paw now looks a little flat}
{5703}{}{. The left paw of the rat is blown off}
{5704}{}{. The right paw is heavily damaged}
{5705}{}{, reducing the right paw to a thin red paste}
{5706}{}{. The rat is seriously wounded by this attack and screeches in pain}
{5707}{}{, seriously wounding the rat and knocking it around}
{5708}{}{ und verspritzt die Ratte über den Boden}
{5709}{}{, easily removing the right leg}
{5710}{}{ und hinterlässt ein großes Loch im linken Bein}
{5711}{}{ und hinterlässt zusätzlichen Schaden, da es sich um eine sensible Stelle handelt}
{5712}{}{, summoning this creature to the great ratcatcher in the sky}
{5800}{}{, the floater drops to the ground}
{5801}{}{, the floater falls to the ground, seemingly lifeless}
{5802}{}{mit ernsthaften Folgen für das Weiterleben des Wesens}
{5803}{}{ und betäubt das eklige Wesen}
{5804}{}{, hitting a sensitive spot there and stunning the floater}
{5805}{}{. Der Schlag lässt den Floater in einer blutroten Wolke erschauern}
{5806}{}{, the blow causing some sort of violent reaction in the creature}
{5807}{}{. The floater suddenly bursts into flames}
{5808}{}{ then it jerks wildly and quivers like a pudding surprise}
{5809}{}{, with the blow hitting a sensitive spot}
{5810}{}{. The creature is obviously agitated}
{5900}{}{, pushed like a bad habit, the centaur falls over and is stunned}
{5901}{}{ , als der Schlag eine kritische Stelle trifft}
{5902}{}{, causing a massive neurological failure}
{5903}{}{ und betäubst es mit deinem heftigen Angriff}
{5904}{}{ und verstümmelt den Arm}
{5905}{}{ striking a critical spot, and crippling the arm}
{5906}{}{, knocking the creature over and crippling the leg}
{5907}{}{ und betäubt den Zentaur, der mit einem verstümmelten Bein umfällt}
{5908}{}{, blinding one head and liquefying the other}
{5909}{}{ und überrascht den Zentaur. Blind strauchelt er einen Augenblick lang}
{5910}{}{ und überrascht den Zentaur. Er bricht in einem Haufen zusammen}
{5911}{}{ und überrascht den Zentaur. Er bricht zu einem Haufen Glibber zusammen}
{5912}{}{. The attack was not as effective as it could have been}
{6000}{}{, inflicting some structural damage}
{6001}{}{, sparks fly and the robot goes momentarily out of control}
{6002}{}{, trifft ein kritisches Bauteil und lässt den Roboter die Kontrolle verlieren}
{6003}{}{, hitting a critical component and causing a massive malfunction}
{6004}{}{. The robot attempts to compensate}
{6005}{}{. The robot strains to compensate}
{6006}{}{, hitting some key part and causing heavy damage}
{6007}{}{ und verursacht schwere strukturelle Schäden}
{6008}{}{, hitting a critical component and causing severe damage}
{6009}{}{. The robot shudders under this intense attack}
{6010}{}{ und zerlegt den Roboter}
{6011}{}{. The robot attempts to compensate, but fails, falling to the ground}
{6012}{}{. The robot strains under the pressure, falling to the ground}
{6013}{}{ und zerstört die Sensorobjektive}
{6100}{}{ und wirft den Köter zu Boden}
{6101}{}{genau auf die Schnauze}
{6102}{}{. The dog falls over, but it is still breathing}
{6103}{}{, the animal coughs up a spurt of blood}
{6104}{}{und verstümmelt das Bein}
{6105}{}{ und verstümmelt das Bein. Das Tier versucht stehenzubleiben, es gelingt ihm aber nicht}
{6106}{}{. The blinded animal howls in pain}
{6107}{}{ und kastriert das arme Tier}
{6200}{}{ und wirft das mutierte Insekt nieder}
{6201}{}{, which collapses}
{6202}{}{. The mantis ponders whether to continue living}
{6203}{}{ und verstümmelt das Glied}
{6204}{}{, causing the mantis to lick its wounds. It holds the limb oddly}
{6205}{}{ und durchdringt den Chitinpanzer}
{6206}{}{. The mantis shrieks and shivers must inhumanly}
{6207}{}{, which causes the mantis to fall over. A limb is bent at an odd shape}
{6208}{}{ und zerfetzt die Flügel}
{6209}{}{, bypassing the chitinous armor and throwing the mantis around}
{6210}{}{ und lässt das Insekt mit einem präzisen Schlag erblinden}
{6300}{}{. Even this beast seems fazed by that stunning attack}
{6301}{}{, slipping past the huge claws to strike the monster. The Deathclaw shakes and growls}
{6302}{}{. The result is massive damage to the Deathclaw's eyes}
{6400}{}{, breaking past his bio-organic defenses}
{6401}{}{, causing him some serious grief}
{6402}{}{, breaking past his bio-organic defenses and putting the pressure on him}
{6403}{}{, stunning him with a solid offensive plan}
{6404}{}{, causing an overload of cataclysmic proportions in his systems}
{6405}{}{. Still, the attack against him seems to do less damage than it should have}
{6406}{}{. The blow gets by his bio-organic defenses, actually blinding him}
{6500}{}{. You'll have a headache tomorrow, if you live that long}
{6501}{}{. Your armor provides no protection from this well-aimed blow}
{6502}{}{. You feel the pain for just a moment, and then darkness takes you..}
{6503}{}{, bypassing your armor. The blow knocks you off your feet}
{6504}{}{, the shock makes your vision go dark. After a moment, you notice that your vision has not returned}
{6505}{}{. You get a nice view of your body as your head sails through the air}
{6506}{}{. Surprisingly, the damage feels no worse than normal}
{6507}{}{und betäubt dich für einen Augenblick}
{6508}{}{. Feel the pain}
{6509}{}{. The attack leaves your arm useless}
{6510}{}{ und umgeht deine Rüstung. Der Schlag bricht die Knochen deines Arms wie totes Holz}
{6511}{}{ und durchdringt deine Rüstung. Dein Arm hängt nun schlaff an der Seite}
{6512}{}{. The bruise will look nice, and maybe the scars will make good party talk}
{6513}{}{ und zerquetscht deine Eingeweide. Du kannst nur noch Blut spucken}
{6514}{}{und schleudert dich kopfüber herum}
{6515}{}{, sending you flying and breaking your leg}
{6516}{}{ und schmilzt durch deine Rüstung. Der Schlag wirft dich um und verletzt dein Knie schwer}
{6517}{}{. The pain from your broken leg causes you to pass out}
{6518}{}{. Der schmerzhafte Schlag lässt dich zucken, sonst nichts}
{6519}{}{. Unlucky for you, it also causes immediate vision loss}
{6520}{}{. It takes you a moment to wipe the blood from your eyes}
{6521}{}{ und durchdringt deine Rüstung. Betäubt wird dir klar, dass du nichts mehr sehen kannst}
{6522}{}{. Ein seltsames Gefühl steigt in deinen Kopf. Dir wird klar, dass dein Gehirntod kurz bevor steht}
{6523}{}{ und lässt dich zusammenzucken}
{6524}{}{. You cup your groin and fall to the floor in pain}
{6525}{}{. Der Schmerz lässt dich ohnmächtig werden. Autsch}
{6526}{}{. There are not enough words in the universe to describe the pain your are feeling at this moment}
